# Multi-Agent Ingestion System

A Python-based multi-agent system that processes PDF, JSON, or raw email input. It uses a Groq LLM (via LangChain) to classify format and business intent, routes the input to a specialized agent, extracts structured data, and logs everything in an SQLite-based memory. A Streamlit UI wraps the entire flow for easy interaction and review.
