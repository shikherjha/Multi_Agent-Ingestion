Subject: Complaint about delayed shipment

Hello Support Team,

I placed an order (Order #12345) on May 20, 2025, but it still hasn’t arrived. The tracking status has not updated in over a week and I’m very concerned.

Please let me know the current status of my shipment and expedite delivery if possible. This is quite urgent as the items are needed for a client presentation next Monday.

Thank you,
Jane Smith
